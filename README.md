# boardgame-icon-templator
This repository provides a basic template for templating icons onto images and providing a clean final output. Only one sample_output.png file is provided, however this was used to create 48 individual and unique pieces with up to 7 permutive icons.
Because this is only intended as a template, the code will not do anything on its own without source image files and should be adapted for use for other projects.
Particularly useful functions may be trim_whitepsace(image) and make_white_transparent(image) as well as the text formatting and icon placement.
